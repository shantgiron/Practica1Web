Questions for sam:
Just to be clear, are we going to take the "test" page just to modify or edit the "blog" page based on the Economics template?
Once we are editing the test template, can we modify the CSS file or this one is the same implemented on the pages that are on production?
What would be better for us to choose, hubspot or work directly with crownpeak?
After we finish editing the test template, we are just going to apply that template to the blog page or what?
